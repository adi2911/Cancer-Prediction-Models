# Cancer Prediction Models

## Description
This project contains prediction using different machine learning classification alogrithms of whether the human cells in the given data are benign or malignant. 
Benign cells means that the cell is not cancerous, malignant cell means the cells are cancerous.
I have listed the performance of all the models, based on which we can decide which model to use for such use cases.

Following is the visualisation of all the models:
